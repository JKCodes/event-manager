# Event Manager

## Overview

Event Manager allows users to create/read/update/delete various events.  Users can only view events that are associated with them.  Creator of an event will automatically have read/update/delete privileges for that event.  All other users for that event will only have read privileges.  Users must be logged in to use Event Manager.  If not logged in, only the welcome page, sign up page, and login page are accessible.  If a user visits any other pages, that uers will be redirected to the login page.
